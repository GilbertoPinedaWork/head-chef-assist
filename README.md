Hi Gilberto Pineda Here!
I had an idea to create a tools for Chefs that makes their non-cooking duties easier.
Initially I started this project locally but then decided this could be an opportunity
to Learn How to Use GitHub.

The Focal Point Of This Project is to manage and create recipes and ingredients,
and to standarize recipes.

After this is done there will be future upgrades

The author of this project does not know much about github so if contributing be patient
